# Home-Automation-ESP32
In this ESP32 project, I have explained how to make IoT based projects using ESP32 with Google Home & Alexa. With this internet of things project, you can control 4 home appliances with Google Assistant, Alexa, and manual switches. You can also control the relays from Google Home and Amazon Alexa App from anywhere in the world.
